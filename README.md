# Server
As a basis for the server, I did not take heavy framework. I take the simple [skeleton](https://github.com/dykyi-roman/no-framework-skeleton)

For run a server - you can create a the docker container(php7.2 + nginx) as the main platform, and put server code here. [Example](docker-project). If you have any problem with a start please contact me. Or if you have a exist server put server code here.

## Install
For up you server you need run only one command:
```composer install```
after that creating a `.env` file with server configuration.
